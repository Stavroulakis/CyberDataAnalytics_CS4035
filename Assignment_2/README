Each of the task are executed in different notebook files.

Each file can run indepedently.

The datasets have to be in the same folder as the notebook files in order to be executed.

For the comparison and bonus task we have produced the necessary csv file (new, sax_prediction, pca_predicted_labels).
You can reproduce them by running the other tasks first.

For the execution of our code the following packages are necessary:
  seaborn
  statsmodels.tsa.arima_model
  statsmodels.api
  sklearn
  statsmodels
(the code was written in python 2)

The report file contains the report of this assignment. However, each of the notebook files contains comments on the individual
tasks. Furthermore in the notebook files all the results are presented, in contrast to report, which contains the most imnportant
ones.
